In this project, the reader might feel free to explore the study performed at subsequent levels to understand that how we came to find the golden cross and the various insights which are accessible in the upcoming chapters. The project team comprises:Vipul H Harihar, Zhaoyu Wu and Zhirui Yang We have have put all our classroom teachings and honest hardwork so as to make this project to reach its conclusion. We hopr the user enjoys it as much as we did building and developing it. Sit for a while because this Project will embrace your knowledge with the unknown of Stock Markets and Golden Cross which is majestic in itself! 1.0.1 Introduction The world is changing and adapting to cope with the major technological advancements and changes but we never realized that ‘Data’, the term that used to describe statistics, would be so huge by the first quarter of the 21st Century. Superficially from a bird’s eye view we may say small governments, corporations, and individuals focus more on human impact to the environment while international financial markets have responded with innovative products to help manage climate risk and invest in mitigating technologies. Big firms play a key function in markets, committing capital to bridge timing differences between buyers and sellers. With the financial industry debating underlying market structure tenets such as tick sizes there has been renewed focus on different types of market making activity. 1.1 Why ‘Stocks’ ? What is ‘Stock Exchange’? A stock or the term share is usually used in representing a company’s equity. We may understand it as a financial instrument that assists in showing ownership in a corporation or a company and it represents a proportionate claim on its assets (what it owns) and earnings (what it generates in profits). When we think of the term share stock exchanges, it is the secondary market, where existing owners of shares can transact these shares of their equities with potential buyers. It is important to comprehend that the corporations on stock markets do not buy and sell their own shares on a regular basis (companies may engage in stock buybacks or issue new shares, but these are not day-to-day operations and often occur outside of the framework of an exchange). So we may sum it as whenever you buy a share of stock on the stock market, you are not buying the stock directly from the company, you are buying it from another existing shareholder. Likewise, when you want to sell the shares you own , they are not sold to the company—rather you sell them to some other investors. Project Problem Statement There are numerous people in the market who want to invest in the stock market are way too afraid to put their life’s savings at stake. Many people pour their life savings and dump their 401K (contribution retirement plan) into the stock and option market. They perform various strategies and financial maneuvers, hoping to gain massive profits but generally end up losing most of their investments or still having underperformance in the general market. Thus, our team started thinking if there is an investing strategy that can consistently beat the index fund return. EDAV Final Project Assignment A recently published article by Barclays on Impact of Retail Options Trading (https://www.docdroid.net/5gM68EW/barclays-us-equity-derivatives-strategy-impact-of-retailoptions-trading-pdf) raised an interesting theory: the market participation of the retail traders (the ordinary traders like us) creates a systematic dislocation between the implied volatility and the actual price volatility of stocks. The article also claims that there are two possible ways to generate profits from this dislocation: • Hedged straddle • Call spreads 1.2 Golden Cross, What’s That? There are three stages to a golden cross. In the second stage, the shorter moving average forms a crossover up through the larger moving average to trigger a breakout and confirmation of trend reversal. The moving averages act as support levels on pullbacks until they crossover back down at which point a death cross may form. The death cross is the opposite of the golden cross as the shorter moving average forms a crossover down through the longer moving average. With a bellwether index, the motto «A rising tide lifts all boats» applies when a golden cross forms as the buying resonates throughout the index components and sectors. Day traders commonly use smaller time periods like the 5-period and 15-period moving averages to trade intra-day golden cross breakouts. The larger the chart time frame, the stronger and lasting the golden cross breakout tends to be. 1.2.1 The Difference Between a Golden Cross and a Death Cross A golden cross indicates a long-term bull market going forward, while a death cross signals a long-term bear market. The golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses over a major long-term moving average to the upside and is interpreted by analysts and traders as signaling a definitive upward turn in a market. Limitations of Using the Golden Cross Many times, an observed golden cross produces a false signal. Despite its apparent predictive power in forecasting prior large bull markets, golden crosses also do regularly fail to manifest. Therefore, a golden cross should always be confirmed with other signals and indicators before putting on a trade. What Does a Golden Cross Indicate? A golden cross suggests a long-term bull market going forward. Are Golden Crosses Reliable Indicators? Traders often use a golden cross as confirmation of a trend or signal in combination with other indicators. Outline of our Work Done in Project • A financial study on the stock market published last year raised an intriguing theory • Golden Cross and it’s capabilities EDAV Final Project Assignment 4 • Data Cleaning and Exploration • Report writing and visuals finalization • Study on the paper published by Barclay Equity Research: Impact of Retail Options Trading 1.3 Goal of our Golden Cross Project: We built a project on these questions: Data Investigation and checking if ‘Golden Cross’ exists by analyzing the trends in the past 10 years data? • Examination from a pure data perspective, using the visualization techniques to demonstrate the difference between the implied volatility and historical volatility. • What are some of the factors that influence the magnitude of this dislocation? • Do spread calls and hedged straddles effectively monetize this dislocation and consistently beat the general market return? (Bootstrap stimulation) • Calculation of the golden cross Data Source and its availability: "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 What is a Good Data Resource?", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 What is a Good Data Resource? Whenever we are working with data, the type to support our claims enhances the validity and impact of whatever you are communicating – but only if your data comes from a reliable source. Whether we’re communicating to our client, all data starts with a good data source. The Components of a Good Data Source We have taken the following teachings taught by our Professor Joyce Robbins, for the good data source Originality Whether we are working with internal or external data, we need to make sure it is always coming from the primary source. If we run across an interesting data set on Wikipedia or in a magazine article or news media (Economic Times in our project), always try to track down the original data source. Without reviewing the primary data ourselves, we can never know if the methods were flawed, the sample size too small, or the questionnaire biased. And as taught by our professor never cite Wikipedia. The Data Scientist must remember: It’s our responsibility to represent the data as close to its original context as possible. Understandable If we have questions unanswered by your data, our audience/client will, too. The data source should provide sufficient information to get the big picture as well as any appropriate context. For example, let’s say your sales metrics show a significant jump in units sold between April and May. But looking at the larger set, we saw that jump came after a general decline. That’s the full story we wanted our data to show without any doubtful areas. Currentness The world is changing quickly. Oftentimes, data that was produced or collected ten years, five years, or even a year ago is obsolete. Thus our data source needs to always use the most recently published version of the data available. Some data producers, such as the Department of Labor, revise their data on an annual or even monthly basis. And in our case, Yahoo Finance has been very current. Ideally, we wanted our data to be at least 5 years old, in our goodwill we got much more than that. Our data comprises stock data for at most 10 years and that it has all significant features and currentness that we were interested in getting for our “Golden Cross” Project. Reliability Verifying that the source you choose is relevant, legitimate, and as unbiased as possible is also important. Strong sources include data collected/produced by government agencies, such as the statistics compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau or the Department of Labor. Other top-tier data sources can include industry white papers or academic publications. We need to remember that surveys conducted by polling agencies or think tanks, while usable, will often have a political agenda. Therefore, as with the case of aged data, use discretion. Avoid data that is anecdotal, user-generated, or based on hearsay. To judge whether or not a source is appropriate, we asked these questions to ourselves as we learned from the Professor: Who wrote the web page? Does the author have credentials? Is this web page affiliated with a credible organization? When was the website with data last updated? What is the purpose of the organization that is hosting the website? Does the author of the webpage provide a bibliography? Data Sources- data has to be historical and the data collection from valid resources Using Accurate metrics to define our problem questions,Plotting exploratory data analytics visuals, including CAGR (componded annual growth rate) and bootstrap simulation Using d3.js / plotly.js for better understanding and deeper insights (if time permits) We have a variety of data sources available to us. But as we are aware of this data being so valuable we couldn’t get it for free thus on digging up deep, we found the Yahoo Finance Website. (The Yahoo! Finance is a media property that is part of the Yahoo! network. It provides financial news, data and commentary including stock quotes, press releases, financial reports, and original content. It also offers some online tools for personal finance management.) We are going to work and cover the industrial giants in the stock market and provide and collate actual and relevant data sources from the Yahoo finance website, itself.

Low: The low is the lowest price of the period. Close: The close is a reference to the end of a trading session in the financial markets when the markets close for the day. Adj Close: The adjusted closing price amends a stock’s closing price to reflect that stock’s value after accounting for any corporate actions. Volume: Is the measure of how much of a given financial asset has traded in a period of time. 2.1.2 Resources: We looked for our project ! The external resources used for our project can be found on the following links: https://www.docdroid.net/5gM68EW/barclays-us-equity-derivatives-strategy-impact-of-retailoptions-trading-pdf https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082614/how-stock-market-works.asp https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp "],["data-cleaning.html", "Chapter 3 Data Cleaning 3.1 Interactive Data Visual Used for checking Data Consistency", " Chapter 3 Data Cleaning Data cleaning is the process of ensuring that the data is Correct Consistent Usable Professor Joyce Robbins have taught us. it is not the ’Data quantity but the data quality which is the most important part of any project. Let us brief down the teachings from her lectures and lay out the process we came through to perform data cleaning in our project. 3.0.1 What is data cleaning? Data cleaning is the process of ensuring data is correct, consistent and usable, as stated above. We must clean data by identifying and looking up for errors or corruptions, correcting or deleting them, or manually processing data as needed to prevent the same errors from occurring when we use the data for exploratory data analysis or visualizations. Most aspects of data cleaning nowadays are performed through software tools usage, but nevertheless it always have some portion of it which must be done manually. Although as we felt data cleaning is an overwhelming task, it is an essential part of managing the data and making it great enough to be used under study and practise. 3.0.2 What are the benefits of data cleaning? There are many benefits to having clean data: It removes majorly all kind of errors and inconsistencies, that are inevitable when multiple sources of data are being pulled and merged into single dataset. Using tools to clean up data usually make everyone in the team more efficient as we were able to quickly get what we need from the data available to us and use it as soon as possible for visualizations and insight generations. It is obvious if we have fewer errors, it would mean happier customers and fewer frustrated employees. It also allows us to map different data functions, and better understand what our data is intended to do, and learn where the data source lies. These are the 6 steps we used for cleaning our data which we learnt in the classroom lectures. 3.0.3 Data cleaning in six steps The first step before starting data cleaning project of Golden Cross Project was to first look at the big picture. Thus we asked the question What are your goals and expectations? from ourselves before begining the data cleaning tasks. To achieve these goals as you might have seen in the previous chapter we had set, the next thing was to plan a data cleanup strategy. Thus the team looked into and came across a great guideline to focus on our top metrics related to stock market data and trends. Some questions that we kept on asking to ourselves during this data cleaning journey were: What is our highest metric in stock data we looking forward to achieve? What is our teams’ overall goal and what is each member looking to achieve from it? For these questions we decided with the key stakeholders together and brainstormed and progressed with the strategy. We got the data from the data sources and digged deeper to create the data cleaning process to be clean and efficient: 1. Monitor errors We kept a record of trends where most of our errors were coming from.This made it a lot easier to identify and fix incorrect or corrupt data. Records were especially important when we were integrating other solutions with our R and Python tools to clean up the data, it was all done to avoid clogging up the work performed by us (the three teammates). 2. Standardize your process Standardization to the point of entry of every stock we had considered was essential to help reduce the risk of duplication. 3. Validate data accuracy Once we had cleaned our existing data, we validate the accuracy of our data. We performed the various techniques to clean our data in real-time which the reader can find and formatted sufficiently in the code base. Nevertheless we were aware that some tools even use AI or machine learning to better test for accuracy, we tried to perform eeverything from scrtach and thus it was a fun adventure for all of us. 4. Scrub for duplicate data We came across duplicates which was mostly due to manual error, but to help save time when analyzing data the repeated data was avoided by researching and investing our individual times so that we can analyze raw data in bulk and speed up the process for our insights derivation. 5. Analyze your data After our data was standardized, validated and scrubbed for duplicates, we created an interactove graph to check it’s reliability and correctness. It’s link can be found in the end of this chapter. 6. Communicate with your team The most important thing in the team project development during these processes is to Communicate. We had to share the new standardized cleaning process with our team to promote adoption of the new protocol that we had used throughout project. Keeping our team in the loop in each and every step helped us develop and strengthen client segmentation (which was Professor Joyce Robbins in our case) and in more general format could have been used to send more targeted information to customers and prospects. Finally we continued to monitor and review data regularly from September to December to catch inconsistencies on weekly basis to get the best data for our project 3.0.4 Codework in the Data Cleaning The reader can check our whole work by visiting the link: https://github.com/virslaan/GoldenCross . In data cleaning (data transformation) chapter, we have used reticulate package in R studio, so we could write python in a .rmd file. When building the book, Python chunk has some problems with compiling. Therefore, we have pushed all my work in this repository. 03-cleaning.Rmd is the data cleaning part. index.html is html file by knitting the .rmd file. interactive_plot_for_processed_data.html is the interactive plot to show our processed data, which can help us have a better understanding about what the processed data look like and how our strategy works. Other files are necessary for this repository, which one can ignore.

All these data are publicly available, so there is no missing values. Although we can regard non-trading days as missing value, in fact these missing values don’t matter at all because all public marketing behaviors stop at these days. Moreover, we are calculating some technical indicators, like moving average with different time span, so there will be some missing values (Null value) at the beginning of the data because there is not enough data to calculate the sliding window. However, in our trading strategies, we need to drop all Null values at the beginning of our backtesting intervals in order to get accurate technical indicators. Therefore, in this way we don’t have any missing value in our raw data and processed data. We will use “backup” data for this missing value chapter. In this chapter, we will use avengers Dataset. 4.1 Basics of avengers Dataset The first step is to load data and check the basic information about the data. We should know the dimension of the dataset and the meaning of each column. ## # A tibble: 6 × 21 ## url name_alias appearances current gender probationary_in… full_reserve_aven… year ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 http://marvel.… &quot;Henry Jonath… 1269 TRUE MALE &lt;NA&gt; Sep-63 1963 ## 2 http://marvel.… &quot;Janet van Dy… 1165 TRUE FEMALE &lt;NA&gt; Sep-63 1963 ## 3 http://marvel.… &quot;Anthony Edwa… 3068 TRUE MALE &lt;NA&gt; Sep-63 1963 ## 4 http://marvel.… &quot;Robert Bruce… 2089 TRUE MALE &lt;NA&gt; Sep-63 1963 ## 5 http://marvel.… &quot;Thor Odinson&quot; 2402 TRUE MALE &lt;NA&gt; Sep-63 1963 ## 6 http://marvel.… &quot;Richard Milh… 612 TRUE MALE &lt;NA&gt; Sep-63 1963 ## # … with 13 more variables: years_since_joining &lt;int&gt;, honorary &lt;chr&gt;, death1 &lt;lgl&gt;, return1 &lt;lgl&gt;, ## # death2 &lt;lgl&gt;, return2 &lt;lgl&gt;, death3 &lt;lgl&gt;, return3 &lt;lgl&gt;, death4 &lt;lgl&gt;, return4 &lt;lgl&gt;, ## # death5 &lt;lgl&gt;, return5 &lt;lgl&gt;, notes &lt;chr&gt; ## [1] &quot;url&quot; &quot;name_alias&quot; &quot;appearances&quot; ## [4] &quot;current&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;probationary_intro&quot; ## [7] &quot;full_reserve_avengers_intro&quot; &quot;year&quot; &quot;years_since_joining&quot; ## [10] &quot;honorary&quot; &quot;death1&quot; &quot;return1&quot; ## [13] &quot;death2&quot; &quot;return2&quot; &quot;death3&quot; ## [16] &quot;return3&quot; &quot;death4&quot; &quot;return4&quot; ## [19] &quot;death5&quot; &quot;return5&quot; &quot;notes&quot; ## [1] 173 21 4.2 Check Missing Values We will check the missing values in the whole data. ## death4 return4 death5 ## 172 172 172 ## return5 death3 return3 ## 172 171 171 ## probationary_intro return2 death2 ## 158 157 156 ## return1 notes full_reserve_avengers_intro ## 104 98 14 ## name_alias url appearances ## 10 0 0 ## current gender year ## 0 0 0 ## years_since_joining honorary death1 ## 0 0 0 ## [1] 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 ## [33] 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 ## [65] 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 10 10 10 ## [97] 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 ## [129] 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 7 ## [161] 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 6 5 0 We can see that there are lots of missing values in the data. To better understand there distribution, we will transfer the missing value into a binary variable “missing”, then plot a heatmap to show the missing value. ## # A tibble: 3,633 × 4 ## id key value missing ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Henry_Pym_(Earth-616) no ## 2 2 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Janet_van_Dyne_(Earth-616) no ## 3 3 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Anthony_Stark_(Earth-616) no ## 4 4 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Robert_Bruce_Banner_(Earth-616) no ## 5 5 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Thor_Odinson_(Earth-616) no ## 6 6 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Richard_Jones_(Earth-616) no ## 7 7 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Steven_Rogers_(Earth-616) no ## 8 8 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Clint_Barton_(Earth-616) no ## 9 9 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Pietro_Maximoff_(Earth-616) no ## 10 10 url http://marvel.wikia.com/Wanda_Maximoff_(Earth-616) no ## # … with 3,623 more rows We can find that most of missing values appeared in the “death” or “return” columns. These columns represent the number of deaths and returns of characters. In Marvels, it is very common for some superheroes or super devils to resurge many times. Therefore, we can estimate that these missing values may represent the importance or the power of characters. For example, some important or powerful characters may seldom die or could resurge every time they die. Therefore, we select all the “death” columns and plot the heatmap. ## # A tibble: 6 × 4 ## name_alias key value missing ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;Henry Jonathan \\&quot;Hank\\&quot; Pym&quot; death1 TRUE no ## 2 &quot;Janet van Dyne&quot; death1 TRUE no ## 3 &quot;Anthony Edward \\&quot;Tony\\&quot; Stark&quot; death1 TRUE no ## 4 &quot;Robert Bruce Banner&quot; death1 TRUE no ## 5 &quot;Thor Odinson&quot; death1 TRUE no ## 6 &quot;Richard Milhouse Jones&quot; death1 FALSE no All the rows (characters) have “True” value in “death1” columns. It means that every character has at least one death, which may represent all the superpowers were born of fire. This is actually how the Marvels start a superhero story. Superhero typically got superpowers by some disasters or accidents at the beginning of the story. Then we can check two famous superheroes, Iron man and Jocasta. ## # A tibble: 1 × 6 ## name_alias death1 death2 death3 death4 death5 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 &quot;Anthony Edward \\&quot;Tony\\&quot; Stark&quot; TRUE NA NA NA NA ## # A tibble: 1 × 6 ## name_alias death1 death2 death3 death4 death5 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 Jocasta TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE We can see that Tony only died once. In Marvels, Iron man is one of the most power superhero, and he fight many times successfully.He only died in the fighting with Thanos. He is also the most important in Marvels movies. And Jocasta is a “non-living” construct.She did not has strong power, but she could resurge because she required no food, water, or oxygen to survive and she was also immune to poisons and diseases. She is also one of the most important character of Marvels cartoons. It fits our initial hypothesisfor the number of daeth. Then we can also show the heatmap of “return” columns. ## # A tibble: 6 × 4 ## name_alias key value missing ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;Henry Jonathan \\&quot;Hank\\&quot; Pym&quot; return1 FALSE no ## 2 &quot;Janet van Dyne&quot; return1 TRUE no ## 3 &quot;Anthony Edward \\&quot;Tony\\&quot; Stark&quot; return1 TRUE no ## 4 &quot;Robert Bruce Banner&quot; return1 TRUE no ## 5 &quot;Thor Odinson&quot; return1 TRUE no ## 6 &quot;Richard Milhouse Jones&quot; return1 NA yes 4.3 Check missing values by year We will check missing values by year. We can find if there is a pattern of the number of death or return. There are the years when the Marvels had a new character. We can see that there are some big gaps between certain years.

We can see that although the number of characters differ greatly each year, the percentage of missing values is pretty stable each year. It means that Marvels will keep certain proportion of character to be alive. 4.4 Using function from Q2 of Pset4 We can see the distribution of missing values by using the function. The result is pretty similar to what we did above. There are only few columns is totally complete and most of missing values are concentrated in “death” and “return” columns. Meanwhile, there is no missing values in some columns including “current”, “year”, “gender”.

We have tried to include the qualitative data visualization over the quantity of data available. The following packages are needed for the visualization: The price data would be acquired from yahoo finance using quantmod package as told to us by our Professor Joyce Robbins. 5.1 Static Cumulative Market Value Plot The plot above is a static cumulative market value plot for Apple. The plot includes price data from 2019-01-01 to 2021-12. At the bottom of the plot, the trading volume of the stock for each recorded trading days are demonstrated in the form of histogram. No clear type of distribution of the volume can be easily identified due to the volatile nature of the stock market. Possible inflex and efflux might be found near the day when Apple announces its quarterly sales report or the day when a new Iphone product goes public. The plot above is a static cumulative market value plot for General Motor. The plot includes price data from 2019-01 to 2021-12. At the bottom of the plot, the trading volume of the stock for each recorded trading days are demonstrated in the form of histogram. No clear type of distribution of the volume can be easily identified due to the volatile nature of the stock market. Possible inflex and efflux might be found near the day when General Motor announces its quarterly sales report. The inflation might also have an effect on the stock price of GM if the price of the raw material go up. The plot above is a static cumulative market value plot for Tesla. The plot includes price data from 2019-01 to 2021-12. At the bottom of the plot, the trading volume of the stock for each recorded trading days are demonstrated in the form of histogram. No clear type of distribution of the volume can be easily identified due to the volatile nature of the stock market. Possible inflex and efflux might be found near the day when Tesla announces its quarterly sales report. Price could also change rapidly if a new Tesla model is published. The direction of the price changes might depend on the performance of the Tesla Press Conference. Tweets sent by Elon Musk might also have some effects on the stock prices. The plot above is a static cumulative market value plot for Microsoft. The plot includes price data from 2019-01 to 2021-12. At the bottom of the plot, the trading volume of the stock for each recorded trading days are demonstrated in the form of histogram. No clear type of distribution of the volume can be easily identified due to the volatile nature of the stock market. Possible inflex and efflux might be found near the day when Microsoft announces its quarterly sales report. Insider trading that traced back to high executives in Microsoft and alleged or verified scandal of key officials of the Microsoft could exert negative influence on the stock prices. The plot above is a static cumulative market value plot for Costco. The plot includes price data from 2019-01 to 2021-12. At the bottom of the plot, the trading volume of the stock for each recorded trading days are demonstrated in the form of histogram. No clear type of distribution of the volume can be easily identified due to the volatile nature of the stock market. Possible inflex and efflux might be found near the day when Costco announces its quarterly sales report. Inflation could exert significant influence on the stock prices as the rise of price of commodities would push up the total sales figure of the products. The plot above is a static cumulative market value plot for Nvidia. The plot includes price data from 2019-01 to 2021-12. At the bottom of the plot, the trading volume of the stock for each recorded trading days are demonstrated in the form of histogram. No clear type of distribution of the volume can be easily identified due to the volatile nature of the stock market. Possible inflex and efflux might be found near the day when Nvidia announces its quarterly sales report. Tech trends such as Metaverse can positively influence the stock price of Nvidia as more buyers hold bullish views on the Tech company. Increasing demand for computational centers could also influence the stock price of Nvidia. 5.2 Bar Chart Using Golden Cross Methodology The plot above is a barchart demonstrating the growth rate of the investment in Apple using Golden Cross Method.

We can see that NVDA has the largest proportion of the trading days where the Golden Cross investment method produces a positive growth rate. Meanwhile, GM has the largest proportion of the trading days where the Golden Cross investment method produces a negative growth rate. 5.4 Ridge Plot for Distribution of Considered Stocks’ Closing Prices The ridge plot above demonstrates the distribution of Closing prices for each selected stock over years (2019 to 2021). As expected, the distribution of TSLA is multimodal due to the high volatility of the stock prices of TSLA. The distribution of the closing prices for the other stocks resemble the normal distribution. Apple has a set of overall higher closing prices comparing to the others while GM has an overall lower closing prices comparing to the other stocks. 5.5 Static Candlestick Plot Demonstrating Stocks’ Price Movement The plot above is a static candlestick plot demonstrating the price movement of Apple with Moving Average lines and Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator (MACD).

The Convergence and Divergence of the short term moving average and long term moving average can be visualized by the MACD indicator, which is useful for the execution of Golden Cross method. 5.6 Golden Cross Investment Return Plot The plot above is a line plot demonstrating the investment returns for different stocks using Golden Cross Method. The initial investment is $10000 for each stocks and we only buy the stock when a buy signal is created. We sell only when a sell signal is created. Buy and sell signals are created based on the following rules: if the short-term moving average line crosses the long-term moving average line from below, a buy signal is created. When the short-term moving average line crosses the long-term moving average line from above, a sell signal is created. As shown in the plot, TSLA gives the greatest return while GM gives the least return. The volatility of TSLA is also much greater than the other stocks in the plot, as TSLA experiences rapid growth over the years. 5.7 Box Plot for Golden Cross Relative Investment Growth Rates The above is a boxplot demonstrating the Golden Cross investment growth rates over the span of trading days. All the boxes are arranged by median in decreasing order. We can see that Nvidia has the highest median growth rates while the General Motor has the lowest growth rate, which explained the reason that the investment in General Motor increase the least in previous plot. TSLA has the most extreme outlier compared to all the other stocks, which accounts for the volatile investment return of TSLA in the previous plot. The plot above is a boxplot demonstrating the Golden Cross Investment Componded Return Rate for all the stocks. The red horizontal dash line represent the average S&amp;P 500 growth from 2019 to 2021. The data of the actual return of S&amp;P 500 over years comes from online Stock Broker. The lowest growth rate is 65% while the highest growth rate is 1826%. The median growth rate is slightly higher than the average growth rate of S&amp;P 500 index funds. Since conventionally the S&amp;P 500 index funds represent the performance of the general stock market, we can see that Golden Cross investment method outperform the general market returns when applied on the selected major stocks. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Plotly and D3 Visulaizations", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.0.1 D3 Visualization We are quite aware of the fact that the d3 component had to be included in the project, it was due to the time constraints and other subject deadlines that we still manage dto make an interactive plot that works somehow and illustrates purpose we are wanting through the interactive line-chart. We have plotted the line chart for three companies and their respective stock values for the month of October against the time using some sample data of a month to create the graph fun to play with and the client may be able to hover over the lines and understand the trend of moving average by seeing where is the point of intersection where the values of the three companies might collide and he may buy or sell the stock accordingly. It is quite intutive in nature as exploratory data analytics has been used in it and it took us a lot of time to built everything from the scratch. Though the graph is insightful in itself but we wanted the project to be more indulging so we have included the plotly interactive candlestick and line charts as well so as to give the project the complete visualistic feel and interpretation. We hope the reader understands and see the efforts we have put in to make this project a success.

The reader must zoom in to the particular sections to understand the trends and read the insights illustrated through the diffrent sections as one zooms into the chart. Note We had tried to fix the overlapping of the plots, but as discussed with Professor Joyce Robbins, and due to limitations of time, we couldn’t make it look much neater, we tried to fix the height and width but at the moment we are not able to fix it, but it serves the purpose as we zoom on the plots 6.1.1 The Link to the code of d3 part is available here: The code to this d3 visual is available on the following link: https://github.com/virslaan/Interactive-d3-Linechart/blob/main/index.html "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Data Visualizations Interpretation 7.2 Golden Cross Comprehension 7.3 Conclusion and What’s Next?", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In this project, we looked into the historical price data of several popular stocks with billion-dollar market capitalization and examine the golden cross pattern. Golden Cross is a chart pattern in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. Eventually, we would like to test whether an investment plan based on the Golden Cross indicator can generate profits for the investors and outperform the general stock market returns. The investment plan is designed as the following: When the short-term moving average line crosses the long-term moving average line from below, a buy signal is generated. When the long-term moving average line crosses the long-term moving average line from above, a sell signal is generated. We tested this investment plan on selected stocks with the historical stocks price movement data. We look forward that this project would help us in exploring the wonderful world of data exploration and analytics. 7.1 Data Visualizations Interpretation The interactive candlestick plots and static cumulative market value plots were first generated. They help us to visualize the actual price movement of the stocks during the selected period (2019-2021). The Moving average convergence divergence(MACD) subplots were also created to help determine different signal points in the golden cross plan. Besides MACD also serve as a momentum indicator, demonstrating the volatile price changes in several selected stocks. To test the golden cross investment plan, we assumed an initial investment of $10000, and we then simulated the execution of the plan on historical data. The selected stocks are AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, GM, COST. The final results indicated that the investment plan managed to create substantial profits for all six stocks, as the compounded growth rates at the end of the simulation are all positive. Various plots and graphs were created to help visualize different aspects of the effect of the investment plan. 7.2 Golden Cross Comprehension On average, the Golden Cross investment plan has around 11% possibility to achieve positive growth for one completed trade. One completed trade is defined as buying the stock when the buy signal is given and then selling it when a sell signal is given. The Golden Cross investment plan reached the highest returns on TSLA since TSLA price is very volatile and the stock experienced several waves of rapid growth in the past. On the contrary, GM provides the lowest returns because the price movement in GM is weak. The volatility of the prices of stocks was illustrated by the ridge plots. In the ridge plot, we can find the multimodal distribution pattern for TSLA, which proves the great volatility in its stock prices over the years. 7.3 Conclusion and What’s Next? The final compounded growth rates were calculated and were compared to the average return rate of S&amp;P 500 index funds. Conventionally, the S&amp;P 500 represents the general stock market returns. The distribution of the compounded growth rates was demonstrated by a boxplot. A red horizontal dash line was drawn to represent the average S&amp;P 500 growth from 2019 to 2021, which is 82.94%. The data of the actual return of S&amp;P 500 over years comes from online Stock Broker. The lowest growth rate is 65% while the highest growth rate is 1826%. The median growth rate is higher than the average growth rate of S&amp;P 500 index funds. Based on all the visualizations and the statistics we had, we concluded that the golden cross investment plan is proven to be a reliable way to generate profits consistently over time. The plan also managed to outperform the general markets for the majority of the selected stocks in this project. In the furture, we can also look into the combination of golden cross plan and RSI indicator. RSI can show whether the underlying stocks are overbought or oversold. Using this indicator together with the golden cross, we can better determine the entry points and exit points to maximize the profits.
