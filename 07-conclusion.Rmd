# Conclusion

In this project, we looked into the historical price data of several popular stocks with billion-dollar market capitalization and examine the golden cross pattern. Golden Cross is a chart pattern in which a relatively short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. Eventually, we would like to test whether an investment plan based on the Golden Cross indicator can generate profits for the investors and outperform the general stock market returns. 

The investment plan is designed as the following: When the short-term moving average line crosses the long-term moving average line from below, a buy signal is generated. When the long-term moving average line crosses the long-term moving average line from above, a sell signal is generated. We tested this investment plan on selected stocks with the historical stocks price movement data. 

The interactive candlestick plots and static cumulative market value plots were first generated. They help us to visualize the actual price movement of the stocks during the selected period (2019-2021). The Moving average convergence divergence(MACD) subplots were also created to help determine different signal points in the golden cross plan. Besides MACD also serve as a momentum indicator, demonstrating the volatile price changes in several selected stocks.

To test the golden cross investment plan, we assumed an initial investment of $10000, and we then simulated the execution of the plan on historical data. The selected stocks are AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, NVDA, GM, COST. The final results indicated that the investment plan managed to create substantial profits for all six stocks, as the compounded growth rates at the end of the simulation are all positive. Various plots and graphs were created to help visualize different aspects of the effect of the investment plan. 

On average, the Golden Cross investment plan has around 11% possibility to achieve positive growth for one completed trade. One completed trade is defined as buying the stock when the buy signal is given and then selling it when a sell signal is given. The Golden Cross investment plan reached the highest returns on TSLA since TSLA price is very volatile and the stock experienced several waves of rapid growth in the past. On the contrary, GM provides the lowest returns because the price movement in GM is weak. The volatility of the prices of stocks was illustrated by the ridge plots. In the ridge plot, we can find the multimodal distribution pattern for TSLA, which proves the great volatility in its stock prices over the years. 

The final compounded growth rates were calculated and were compared to the average return rate of S&P 500 index funds. Conventionally, the S&P 500 represents the general stock market returns. The distribution of the compounded growth rates was demonstrated by a boxplot. A red horizontal dash line was drawn to represent the average S&P 500 growth from 2019 to 2021, which is 82.94%. The data of the actual return of S&P 500 over years comes from online Stock Broker. The lowest growth rate is 65% while the highest growth rate is 1826%. The median growth rate is higher than the average growth rate of S&P 500 index funds. 

Based on all the visualizations and the statistics we had, we concluded that the golden cross investment plan is proven to be a reliable way to generate profits consistently over time. The plan also managed to outperform the general markets for the majority of the selected stocks in this project. In the furture, we can also look into the combination of golden cross plan and RSI indicator. RSI can show whether the underlying stocks are overbought or oversold. Using this indicator together with the golden cross, we can better determine the entry points and exit points to maximize the profits.
