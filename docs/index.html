<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Final Project Group: Vipul Harihar, Zhaoyu Wu and Zhirui Yang Introduction</h2>
<p>The world is changing and adapting to cope with the major technological advancements and changes but we never realized that ‘Data’, the term that used to describe statistics, would be so huge by the first quarter of the 21st Century. Superficially from a bird’s eye view we may say small governments, corporations, and individuals focus more on human impact to the environment while international financial markets have responded with innovative products to help manage climate risk and invest in mitigating technologies. Big firms play a key function in markets, committing capital to bridge timing differences between buyers and sellers. With the financial industry debating underlying market structure tenets such as tick sizes there has been renewed focus on different types of market making activity.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-stocks-what-is-stock-exchange" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Why ‘Stocks’ ? What is ‘Stock Exchange’?</h2>
<p>A stock or the term share is usually used in representing a company’s equity. We may understand it as a financial instrument that assists in showing ownership in a corporation or a company and it represents a proportionate claim on its assets (what it owns) and earnings (what it generates in profits). When we think of the term share stock exchanges, it is the secondary market, where existing owners of shares can transact these shares of their equities with potential buyers. It is important to comprehend that the corporations on stock markets do not buy and sell their own shares on a regular basis (companies may engage in stock buybacks or issue new shares, but these are not day-to-day operations and often occur outside of the framework of an exchange). So we may sum it as whenever you buy a share of stock on the stock market, you are not buying the stock directly from the company, you are buying it from another existing shareholder. Likewise, when you want to sell the shares you own , they are not sold to the company—rather you sell them to some other investors.</p>
<p>Project Problem Statement There are numerous people in the market who want to invest in the stock market are way too afraid to put their life’s savings at stake. Many people pour their life savings and dump their 401K (contribution retirement plan) into the stock and option market. They perform various strategies and financial maneuvers, hoping to gain massive profits but generally end up losing most of their investments or still having underperformance in the general market. Thus, our team started thinking if there is an investing strategy that can consistently beat the index fund return.</p>
<p>EDAV Final Project Assignment</p>
<p>A recently published article by Barclays on Impact of Retail Options Trading (<a href="https://www.docdroid.net/5gM68EW/barclays-us-equity-derivatives-strategy-impact-of-retailoptions-trading-pdf" class="uri">https://www.docdroid.net/5gM68EW/barclays-us-equity-derivatives-strategy-impact-of-retailoptions-trading-pdf</a>) raised an interesting theory: the market participation of the retail traders (the ordinary traders like us) creates a systematic dislocation between the implied volatility and the actual price volatility of stocks. The article also claims that there are two possible ways to generate profits from this dislocation: • Hedged straddle • Call spreads</p>
</div>
<div id="what-does-a-golden-cross-tell-you" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> What Does a Golden Cross Tell You?</h2>
<p>There are three stages to a golden cross. In the second stage, the shorter moving average forms a crossover up through the larger moving average to trigger a breakout and confirmation of trend reversal. The moving averages act as support levels on pullbacks until they crossover back down at which point a death cross may form. The death cross is the opposite of the golden cross as the shorter moving average forms a crossover down through the longer moving average.</p>
<p>With a bellwether index, the motto «A rising tide lifts all boats» applies when a golden cross forms as the buying resonates throughout the index components and sectors. Day traders commonly use smaller time periods like the 5-period and 15-period moving averages to trade intra-day golden cross breakouts. The larger the chart time frame, the stronger and lasting the golden cross breakout tends to be.</p>
<p>The Difference Between a Golden Cross and a Death Cross</p>
<p>A golden cross indicates a long-term bull market going forward, while a death cross signals a long-term bear market. The golden cross occurs when a short-term moving average crosses over a major long-term moving average to the upside and is interpreted by analysts and traders as signaling a definitive upward turn in a market.</p>
<p>Limitations of Using the Golden Cross</p>
<p>Many times, an observed golden cross produces a false signal. Despite its apparent predictive power in forecasting prior large bull markets, golden crosses also do regularly fail to manifest. Therefore, a golden cross should always be confirmed with other signals and indicators before putting on a trade.</p>
<p>What Does a Golden Cross Indicate?</p>
<p>A golden cross suggests a long-term bull market going forward.</p>
<p>Are Golden Crosses Reliable Indicators?</p>
<p>Traders often use a golden cross as confirmation of a trend or signal in combination with other indicators.</p>
<p>How are we going to Proceed?</p>
<p>Data Sources- data has to be historical
Data Collection from valid resources
Using Accurate metrics to define our problem questions
Plotting exploratory data analytics visuals, including CAGR (componded annual growth rate) and bootstrap simulation
Using d3.js / plotly.js for better understanding and deeper insights (if time permits)
Summary: What are we going to do in the primary phase of the project?
• A financial study on the stock market published last year raised an intriguing theory
• Golden Cross and it’s capabilities EDAV Final Project Assignment 4
• Data Cleaning and Exploration
• Report writing and visuals finalization
• Study on the paper published by Barclay Equity Research: Impact of Retail Options Trading</p>

<div id="current-questions-under-study-we-are-primarily-focusing-on-these-questions-mentioned-below" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Current Questions under study: We are primarily focusing on these questions mentioned below:</h2>
<p>Data Investigation and checking if ‘olden Cross’ exists by analyzing the trends in the past 10 years data?
Examination from a pure data perspective, using the visualization techniques to demonstrate the difference between the implied volatility and historical volatility.
What are some of the factors that influence the magnitude of this dislocation?
Do spread calls and hedged straddles effectively monetize this dislocation and consistently beat the general market return? (Bootstrap stimulation)
Calculation of the golden cross Data Source and its availability: We have a variety of data sources available to us. But as we are aware of this data being so valuable we couldn’t get it for free thus on digging up deep, we found the Yahoo Finance Website. (The Yahoo! Finance is a media property that is part of the Yahoo! network. It provides financial news, data and commentary including stock quotes, press releases, financial reports, and original content. It also offers some online tools for personal finance management.) We are going to work and cover the industrial giants in the stock market and provide and collate actual and relevant data sources from the Yahoo finance website, itself.</p>
